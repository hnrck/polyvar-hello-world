# polyvar-hello-world
Just a simple Haskell "Hello World" using homemade polyvariadic function :yum:

This project is used for me to remember how to create polyvariadic functions.

## Stack based
This project used stack. Once installed, you can use the ```stack``` command to launch and/or test the project.

### Repl
Run main in ```stack repl```.

### Test
You can check that it works with ```stack test```.
